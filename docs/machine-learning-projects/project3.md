# Machine Learning Project 3

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the third machine learning project included in this documentation.

## Project Description

Project 3 focuses on [insert project focus here, e.g., "predicting housing prices using regression techniques"]. The goal of this project is to [insert goal here, e.g., "develop a model that accurately predicts the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, and amenities"].

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [insert dataset name or description here, e.g., "the Boston Housing dataset"]. It contains [insert number of samples and features, e.g., "506 samples with 13 features"].

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - [Insert preprocessing steps, e.g., "Handling missing values, normalizing data, etc."]
   
2. **Model Selection**: 
   - [Insert model selection details, e.g., "Using linear regression, decision trees, etc."]
   
3. **Training**: 
   - [Insert training process, e.g., "The model was trained using a training set of 80% of the data."]

4. **Evaluation**: 
   - [Insert evaluation metrics, e.g., "The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics."]

## Results

The results of the project indicate that [insert key findings, e.g., "the model achieved an RMSE of X and an R-squared value of Y"].

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates [insert conclusion, e.g., "the effectiveness of regression techniques in predicting housing prices"]. Future work may include [insert future work suggestions, e.g., "exploring more complex models or incorporating additional features"].
